	| Filters
	|--------------------------------------------------------------------------
	|
	| Filters provide a convenient method for attaching functionality to your
	| routes. Filters can run either before or after a route is exectued.
	|
	| The built-in "before" and "after" filters are called before and after
	| every request to your application; however, you may create other filters
	| that can be attached to individual routes.
	|
	| Filters also make common tasks such as authentication and CSRF protection
	| a breeze. If a filter that runs before a route returns a response, that
	| response will override the route action.
	|
	| Let's walk through an example...
	|
	| First, define a filter:
	|
	|		'simple_filter' => function()
	|		{
	|			return 'Filtered!';
	|		}
	|
	| Next, attach the filter to a route:
	|
	|		'GET /' => array('before' => 'simple_filter', function()
	|		{
	|			return 'Hello World!';
	|		})
	|
	| Now every requests to http://example.com will return "Filtered!", since
	| the filter is overriding the route action by returning a value.
	|
	| To make your life easier, we have built authentication and CSRF filters
	| that are ready to attach to your routes. Enjoy.
