	| Named views give you beautiful syntax when working with your views.
	|
	| Here's how to define a named view:
	|
	|		'home.index' => array('name' => 'home')
	|
	| Now, you can create an instance of that view using the very expressive
	| View::of dynamic method. Take a look at this example:
	|
	|		return View::of_home();
	|
	| View composers provide a convenient way to add common elements to a view
	| each time it is created. For example, you may wish to bind a header and
	| footer partial each time the view is created.
	|
	| The composer will receive an instance of the view being created, and is
	| free to modify the view however you wish. Here is how to define one:
	|
	|		'home.index' => function($view)
	|		{
	|			//
	|		}
	|
	| Of course, you may define a view name and a composer for a single view:
	|
	|		'home.index' => array('name' => 'home', function($view)
	|		{
	|			//
	|		})	
	|
	*/

	'home.index' => array('name' => 'home', function($view)
	{
		// This composer is called for the "home.index" view.
	}),

);
